## NodeJS, Express, MongoDB Bootcamp

This repository contains the project code that I wrote while completing the NodeJS, Express, MongoDB Bootcamp course on Udemy. The course covered how to build web applications using NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB, and I learned a lot about how to set up my development environment, build a RESTful API, create web applications, and implement authentication and authorization systems.

## Getting Started

To get started with this code, you will need to have NodeJS and MongoDB installed on your computer. You can download and install NodeJS from the official website, and you can download and install MongoDB from the official website or by using a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas.

Once you have NodeJS and MongoDB installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

` git clone https://github.com/shanmukhipriya99/natours-app.git `

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

` npm install `

` npm start `

## Conclusion

Completing this course and building a functional web application using NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB has been an exciting and rewarding experience. I am proud of the work I have done, and I look forward to continuing to develop my skills as a full-stack web developer.
